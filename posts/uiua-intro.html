        Note:

        This post won't teach you Uiua.
        Instead, the <a href="https://uiua.org">Uiua website</a> has a tutorial.

      Uiua is a <em>stack-based, array-oriented</em> programming language that
      uses glyphs to represent its built-in functions and operators. For
      example, a simple Uiua program might look like this:
      <pre><code>
            Sum ← /+
            Avg ← ÷⧻⟜Sum
            Avg [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
        </code></pre>
        Let's break this down.
        The first line defines a function called <code>Sum</code>, that will run the <code>/+</code> glyphs when called.
        The <code>/</code> glyph is a modifier called <code>reduce</code>, that takes a function as an argument, here the <code>+</code> function,
        and uses it to reduce an array. So the <code>Sum</code> function sums an array.

        The next line defines the <code>Avg</code> function, to take the average of an array.
        It starts by calling the <code>Sum</code> function on the values passed to it (uiua code runs right-to-left), with the <code>⟜</code> modifier applied to it.
        <code>⟜</code> is a useful modifier that keeps a function's first argument on top of the stack, so the original array will be kept on the top of the stack.
        The next glyph, <code>⧻</code> takes the length of an array. Finally, the divide (<code>÷</code>) glyph divides the su by the length.

        The final line puts the array <code>[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]</code> onto the stack, and then calls the average function.
        The final output will then be 4.
